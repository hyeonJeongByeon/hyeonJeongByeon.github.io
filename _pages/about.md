I am a first-year Ph.D. stuent in the [Human-Centered Design & Engineering](https://www.hcde.washington.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/), advised by Prof. [Gary Hsieh](https://faculty.washington.edu/garyhs/) and Prof. [Sean A. Munson](https://www.smunson.com/). 



My research interests are designing and building user-friendly systems that enhance online experiences. Also, I aim to harness computational methods to advocate for positive behavior and address health-related issues experienced by marginalized populations.
