## Abstract


The client-clinician relationship is crucial for the success of mental health care treatments. However, the process of finding a well-matched clinician remains challenging for many individuals, particularly those new to mental healthcare. In this study, we explore the dynamic journey of experiences and challenges clients face in navigating the clinician selection and engagement process. Through interviews with 22 participants who have interacted with multiple clinicians in the U.S., we identified key factors influencing their decisions to continue or change clinicians, as well as the resources they utilized during their search. While participants acknowledged the importance of factors previous research noted in their clinician match and therapeutic alliance, they also experienced difficulty assessing these characteristics before engagement. Our findings highlight opportunities to improve upon the process by which people match clinicians, including the limited effectiveness of existing technology and the need for personalized guidance.
