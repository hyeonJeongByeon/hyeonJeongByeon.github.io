## Motivation:
The motivation for this study lies in the potential of storytelling and bibliotherapy to enhance mental health support within personal informatics and self-tracking. Storytelling has been shown to facilitate empathy, self-reflection, and behavioral change, yet its integration into self-tracking tools for mental health remains underexplored. 

In this study, I attempted to identify the persona components that shape an individual's personal narrative and to explore the effectiveness of AI-generated stories with varying degrees of similarity to those components.
